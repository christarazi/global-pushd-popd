# global-pushd-popd
A global pushd / popd like Unix utlilty designed to behave exectly like `pushd` and `popd` except that it works globally. The stack is not bound by a terminal process. So you can push a directory from one terminal process and pop it from another. I developed this because it would come in handy when I have muiltiple terminals open.
